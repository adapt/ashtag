            <p>Ash dieback disease has been rapidly spreading across the country since October 2012, and sightings have been confirmed from Edinburgh to Penzance. The race is now on to help scientists understand how the disease spreads and to identify potentially resistant trees.</p>

            <p>To reach these goals, we need you to help us AshTag the UK’s ash trees. We’ve produced a <a href="{% url 'store:tagpacks' %}">smart, fully recyclable tagging pack</a> that will enable you to physically tag any ash tree, <em>diseased or otherwise</em>, with a numbered aluminium AshTag and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging">geo-tag</a> it to become the ‘steward’ of that tree. </p>

            <p>You can track the progress of your trees over time as you and others submit photos of them. You can also use the live map of all tagged trees to go ‘AshTag hunting’, and see how many tagged trees you can find. </p>

            <p>The photo gallery users will create for each tagged  ash tree will help scientists to identify how the disease progresses and, crucially, the characteristics of trees which don’t get the disease and appear to be less susceptible. </p>

            <p>Professor Allan Downie of the <a href="http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/index.htm">John Innes Centre</a> is leading a network of research groups in a project called <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/news/fundamental-bioscience/2013/130308-pr-bioscience-to-battle-ash-dieback.aspx">Nornex</a>, which aims to provide tools that can help understand, and ultimately limit the impact of ash dieback. We will be feeding our data into this group and Allan has told us how "...it will be of great help to engage the public in identifying trees that do not show Chalara-induced disease symptoms in situations where adjacent trees are severely diseased.</p>

            <p>We’ve come a long way since the launch of AshTag, back in October 2012. When the news that ash dieback had been found wild in the UK first hit the headlines, the team were keen to do something to help.  We worked around the clock to rapidly develop a smartphone app that enabled thousands of you to identify diseased trees and submit photos to be assessed by experts, to track how the disease was spreading across the UK.</p>

            <p>This was a good start, but thanks to the support of the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, AshTag can now go a step further. By physically tagging ash trees, we can build up a clear picture of how ash dieback affects trees in the long term, and hopefully track down resistant trees that can be used to fight back against this devastating disease. Together, we can ensure that ash trees continue to thrive in the UK for generations to come. </p>
