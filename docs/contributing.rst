Contributing to AshTag
======================

All are welcome to contribute to AshTag!

If you're a coder and you'd like to help out, then you're already reading the
docs which is an excellent start. Continue reading to get going.

If you're not a coder, you can still help! Send your ideas to us by adding an
'issue' here: https://github.com/adapt/ashtag/issues


Code style
----------

While we're very grateful for contributions, we also like clean code! If you'd
like to contribute any python code, please make sure you have read PEP-8 and
PEP-257 first.

Your editor should be using soft tabs, set to 4 spaces, and should remove any
trailing whitespace when you save.

If you are using something like vim or emacs, you can install flake8 to ensure
you stay on the straight and narrow ;)

If you are using any other editor, why not add to these docs so we all know how
to stay on the straight and narrow!
